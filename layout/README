MEMORY_MAX_SIZE for microSD card values should be reviewed by customer following microSD card material used.

Under Linux environment, following steps will give the microSD card size:
- insert microSD card in Linux PC
- open shell terminal and execute command:  sgdisk -p /dev/mmcblk<x> (<x> is your local mmcblk id mounted for your microSD card, can check it with lsblk command)
- it will list information below:

		Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 15433728 sectors, 7.4 GiB
		Logical sector size: 512 bytes
		Disk identifier (GUID): 8EC673F7-3653-47C0-8B07-02E04B1DD0E6
		Partition table holds up to 128 entries
		First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 15433694
		Partitions will be aligned on 2-sector boundaries
		Total free space is 0 sectors (0 bytes)

- first line show the microSD card available size: here 15433728 sectors
- to calculate the size in MiB: size = (NbSectors * SectorSize) / 1024 / 1024

		In this example: (15433728 * 512) / 1024 / 1024 = 7536 MiB

- report this value in android_layout.config for your configuration: i.e PART_8GiB_MEMORY_MAX_SIZE 7536M x1 sd
